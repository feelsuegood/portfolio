# Hello, I’m @feelsuegood.

I’m a full-stack software developer with a deep interest in AI-powered applications.

I’ve built real-world projects that connect frontend, backend, and cloud services with AI using tools like TypeScript, React, Django, Node.js, LangChain, and OpenAI.

I’m committed to writing clean, maintainable code and growing as part of a collaborative team. I love building software that delivers real value to users.
